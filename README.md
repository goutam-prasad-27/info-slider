**Info Slider**

This is a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for an info slider website. It displays images with descriptions and allows users to navigate through them using buttons and thumbnails.

**Features:**

-    Slideshow with various images.
-    Each slide contains an image, title, topic, description, and like/see more buttons.
-    Thumbnails for all images displayed at the bottom.
-    Previous and Next buttons for navigation.
-    Smooth transitions for content and thumbnails.

**Getting Started:**

1. Save the code as `index.html` and the images in a folder named `images`.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

**Code Breakdown:**

-    **HTML:**
     -    The code structure includes `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
     -    The `<head>` section contains meta information, links to CSS stylesheets (`style.css`), and JavaScript files (`script.js`).
     -    The `<body>` section defines the website's content layout.
          -    A header (`<header>`) with navigation links (`<nav>`).
          -    A main content area (`<div class="wrapper">`) containing the image slider.
               -    Each slide is represented by a `<div class="items">` element.
                    -    An image (`<img>`) for the slide.
                    -    Content section (`<div class="content">`) with details like title, topic, description, and buttons.
               -    A thumbnail section (`<div class="thumbnail">`) displaying thumbnails for all images.
               -    Navigation buttons (`<button>`) for previous and next slides.
-    **CSS:**
     -    The code in `style.css` defines styles for various elements like fonts, colors, layout, and animations.
-    **JavaScript (script.js):** (not provided in this example)
     -    This file would likely contain functionality for user interactions like button clicks, image transitions, and potentially autoplay features.

**Customization:**

-    You can modify the HTML content to change the displayed images, titles, topics, and descriptions.
-    Edit the CSS styles to adjust the website's appearance (fonts, colors, layouts).
-    Implement JavaScript functionalities for further interactivity.
